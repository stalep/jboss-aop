<h2> Observable</h2>

</p><p>
Defines a one to many relationship between the Subject (the object being observed) and the Observers
where the Observers are notified of changed state in the Subject.
</p><p>
<h3> The problem</h3>

</p><p>
We have a Temperature object and we want to log the changes to the temperature.\\
Using OOPS we would have to modify the Temperature class.\\
Using AOP we can Introduce new behaviour without touching the original class.
</p><p>
We already have a logging utility class and we don't need to change that either.\\
There is no need for it to know about the Temperature class.\\
Again we can Introduce new behaviour.
</p><p>
<h3> Implementation</h3>

</p><p>
The jboss implementation of the pattern
</p><p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="Observer.html">Observer</a> - the interface "implemented" by the Observer</li>
<li> <a href="Subject.html">Subject</a> - the interface "implemented" by the Subject</li>
<li> <a href="SubjectImpl.html">SubjectImpl</a> - we use an Introduction to make Objects into Subjects</li>
<li> <a href="SubjectInterceptor.html">SubjectInterceptor</a> - this advice tracks the state of the Subject and  fires the changes to the Observers</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3> Existing Code</h3>

</p><p>
The exisiting application that knows nothing about the Observable pattern
</p><p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="Temperature.html">Temperature</a> - simple POJO holding a temperature value in its state</li>
<li> <a href="LogUtil.html">LogUtil</a> - simple POJO that logs to System.out</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3> Integration Code</h3>

</p><p>
To integrate the two classes we write an Introduction for <tt>LogUtil</tt> that tells it log the changes in Subjects.
<ul>
<li> <a href="LogUtilObserver.html">LogUtilObserver</a> - makes <tt>LogUtil</tt> into a generic Observer without changing the original code</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3> Configuration</h3>

</p><p>
Now we use AOP to tie it all together
<ul>
<li> <a href="observable_xml.html">jboss-aop.xml</a> - the JBossAOP deployment description</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3> The test class</h3>

<ul>
<li> <a href="GOFObserverableTest.html">ObserverableTest</a> - A simple test</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3> The output</h3>

It doesn't look very exciting but ...
<pre>
Received Notification: Temperature=10
</pre>
</p><p>
<h3> Conclusion</h3>

<ul>
<li> We have taken two existing <a href="/Wiki.jsp?page=POJO">POJO</a>s that know nothing about the Observable pattern and integrated them using AOP.</li>
<li> The only code we had to write was how to handle the change notification: <a href="LogUtilObserver.html">LogUtilObserver</a> which is exactly what you want to write when you are the integerator</li>
<li> JBoss has already implemented the Observable pattern, we don't have to write this boiler plate code.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<ul>
<li> <b>AOP is a very powerful tool for integrating reusable components without touching the original code</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<ul>
<li> <b>You no longer have to repeat boiler plate code</b> in all classes just in case somebody might want a particular feature - <b>a boring task that is prone to error</b> and difficult to change when it is spread across many classes</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h3> Things to try</h3>

<ul>
<li> Use <a href="remoting.html">AOPRemoting</a> to make this pattern distributed</li>
</ul>
