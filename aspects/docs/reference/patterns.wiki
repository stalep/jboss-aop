!! Gang Of Four Patterns

The GOF patterns can be implementated using AOP to avoid having to repeat the same boiler plate code

* [Observable|GOFObservable.html] - Notification of changed state in an object 

* Another obvious candidate is [Visitor | http://www.castle-cadenza.demon.co.uk/visitor.htm] which should fit the same introduction pattern.
