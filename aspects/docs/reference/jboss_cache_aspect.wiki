!!!What is JBossCache

JBossCache consists of two modules: 
*[TreeCache|http://docs.jboss.org/jbcache/TreeCache.html]--a replicated transactional tree-structured cache 
*[TreeCacheAop|http://docs.jboss.org/jbcache/TreeCacheAop.html]--an 'object-oriented' cache using AOP to dynamically manage Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).
\\
A [tutorial|http://docs.jboss.org/jbcache/Tutorial.html] and [faq|http://docs.jboss.org/jbcache/FAQ.html] for both TreeCache and TreeCacheAop are also provided. JBossCache can be used either inside JBoss or as a standalone. 

!! News

* TreeCache (tree structured node based cache)

     isolation levels.
** eviction policy. User can write its own eviction policy via a plugin.
     There is a org.jboss.cache.eviction.LRUPolicy class as an implementation
     of [LRU] algorithm.
** Run under JBoss4.0 and 3.2.4 (and up) as a MBean service

* TreecacheAop ('object-oriented' cache)
** Provides same features as TreeCache: cache mode, transaction, and eviction
     policy
** Run under JBoss4.0 as a MBean service
** eviction policy. Provides an aop-specific policy implementation,
     org.jboss.cache.eviction.AopLRUPolicy
** 'object-oriented' features (in replication mode as well):
*** inheritance
*** aggregation
*** object graph handling
