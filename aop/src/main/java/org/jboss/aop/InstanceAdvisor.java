/**
 * Holds an object instance's metadata and attached interceptor chain.

 * The interceptor chain attached to an advised object contains interceptors that are
 * applied to every method execution and field access joinpoint of that object.
 * At startup, the instance interceptor chain is always empty. This chain is
 * specially tailored for per-instance dynamic AOP operations, allowing the addition
 * and removal of interceptors at runtime. The order in which the interceptors are
 * invoked depends on which method was used to add them to the chain (for more
 * information, see {@link #insertInterceptor } and {@link #appendInterceptor}
 * methods). 
 * <br>
 * Notice that every interceptor chain operation provided by an instance
 * advisor affects only the advised object interceptor chain, and hence it will not
 * affect other advised instances, regardless of whether they belong to the same
 * class or not.
