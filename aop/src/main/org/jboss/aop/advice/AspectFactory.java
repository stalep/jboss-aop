/**
 * Creates aspect instances.
 * <p>
 * This interface must be implemented by all aspect factories. Declare aspect
 * factories instead of the real aspect class when you want:
 * <ul>
 * <li> to perform some specific action during aspect instance creation  (like some
 *      initialization that could not be performed by the aspect constructor,
 *      for example);</li>
 * <li> to create instances of different classes, according to the context where
 *      the aspect will be invoked.</li>
 * <li> or to do anything else that could not be done without implementing a factory;
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This interface provides different methods. However, only the one(s) correspondent
 * to the {@link Scope} of the aspect will be called. Hence, when writing an aspect
 * factory whose scope is known (and is not intended to change), the implemention of
 * the other methods can be empty. However, we advise throwing a runtime exception
 * from those methods instead of simply returning {@code null}, to alert for
 * unpredicted scenarios in case the {@code Scope} value is not the expected.  
 * <p>
