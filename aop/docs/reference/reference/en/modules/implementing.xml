      <para>
         JBoss AOP is a 100% pure Java framework.  All your AOP constructs are defined as pure Java classes and
         bound to your application code via XML or by annotations.  This Chapter walks through implementing aspects.

      <title>Invocation Object</title>
      <para>
         Invocation objects are the runtime encapsulation of their joinpoint.  They contain runtime information of
         their joinpoint (args, java.lang.reflect.*, etc..), and they also drive the flow of aspects.

      <para>
         The example above is of an advice
         <literal>trace</literal> that traces calls to any type of joinpoint.
         Notice that <literal>Invocation</literal> objects are the runtime encapsulation of joinpoints.
         The method <literal>invocation.invokeNext()</literal> is used to drive the advice chain.  It either calls
         the next advice in the chain, or does the actual method or constructor invocation.

           can be an advice.  The

           happen.
      </para>
<!--      <para>
         Method names can be overloaded for different invocation types.  For instance, let's
         say you wanted to have a different trace advice for each invocation type.  You can specify the same method
         name "trace" and just overload it with the concreate invocation type.

      <title>Resolving Annotations</title>
      <para>
         JBoss AOP provides an abstraction for resolving JDK 5.0 annotations. 
         In future versions of JBoss AOP, there will be a way to override annotation values on a
         per thread basis, or via XML overrides, or even provide VM and cluster wide defaults for annotation values.
         Also if you want to write a truly generic advice that takes the base Invocation type, you can still get the
         annotation value of the method, constructor, or field you're invoking on by calling this method:
      </para>
      <programlisting>Object resolveAnnotation(Class annotation);</programlisting>

         That's just resolving for resolving member annotations.  If your aspect needs to resolve class level annotations

         <para>
            Untyped metadata can be defined within XML files and bound to org.jboss.aop.metadata.SimpleMetaData structures.
            This XML data can be attached per method, field, class, and constructor.
            To resolve this type of metadata, the Invocation object provides a method to abstract out where the
            metadata comes from.

                  allows you to override metadata for the whole thread.  The metadata is managed by a ThreadLocal.
                  ThreadMetaData is used by every single invocation object at runtime.

         <para>
         You can attach untyped metadata to the invocation object, or even to the response.  This allows advices
         to pass contextual data to one another in the incoming invocation or outgoing response for instance if you
         had advices running on a remote client that wanted to pass contextual data to server-side aspects.  This method
         on invocation gets you access to a
            <literal>org.jboss.aop.metadata.SimpleMetaData</literal> instance so that you can attach
         or read data.

         <programlisting>SimpleMetaData getMetaData()</programlisting>
         <para>
            <literal>SimpleMetaData</literal> has three types of metadata, AS_IS, MARSHALLED, and TRANSIENT.  This allows
         you to specify whether or not metadata is marshalled across the wire.  TRANSIENT says, attached metadata
         should not be sent across the wire.  MARSHALLED is for classloader sensitive contextual data.  AS_IS doesn't
         care about classloaders.  Read the Javadocs for more information.

         To piggyback and read metadata on the invocation response, two methods are provided.  One to attach data

      <para>
         Mixins are a type of introduction in which you can do something like C++ multiple inheritance and force
         an existing Java class to implement a particular interface and the implementation of that particular interface
         is encapsulated into a particular class called a mixin.
      </para>

   <sect1 id="impl-dyn-cflow" revision="1">
      <title>Dynamic CFlow</title>
      <para>
         Dynamic CFlows allow you to define code that will be executed that must be resolved true to trigger
         positive on a cflow test on an advice binding. (See <![CDATA[<cflow-stack>]]> for more information).
         The test happens dynamically at runtime and when combined with a pointcut expression allows you to
         do runtime checks on whether a advice binding should run or not.

         To implement a dynamic CFlow you just have to implement the simple org.jboss.aop.pointcut.DynamicCFlow
         interface.  You can then use it within cflow expressions.  (See XML or Annotations)
