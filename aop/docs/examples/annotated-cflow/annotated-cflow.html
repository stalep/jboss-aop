<h2>Annotated Control Flow</h2>

</p><p>
<h4>Overview</h4>

The principles behind CFlow when using annotations is exactly the same as when using <a href="cflow/cflow.html">XML</a>, all that is different is the way of defining it.
</p><p>
<h4>@CFlowStackDef and @CFlowDef</h4>

MyAspect contains a few @CFlowStackDef annotated fields:
</p><p>
<pre>
   @CFlowStackDef (cflows={@CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;method1()", called=true), @CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;method2()", called=true), @CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;method3()", called=true)})
   public static CFlowStack cf123Before;
</pre>
</p><p>
The first one declares that method1, method2, and method3 should be in the call stack in that order.  The next
<pre>
   @CFlowStackDef (cflows={@CFlowDef(expr = "POJO-&gt;new()", called=true), @CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;method3()", called=true)})
   public static CFlowStack cf1ConAnd3;
</pre>
Says that the POJO constructor with an int parameter and method3 must be in the call stack in that order. As for <a href="../annotated-composition/annotated-composition.html">Annotated composition</a> and  <a href="../annotated-typedef/annotated-typedef.html">Annotated typedefs</a> the fully qualified name of the <tt>@CFlowStackDef</tt> annotated field is used when we reference the CFlowStackDef by name. Again, the type <tt>CFlowStack</tt> is used as the type of the field for clarity, even though the actual type of the field is irrelevant.
</p><p>
<h4>Apply a @CFlowStackDef</h4>

You can reference the CFlowStackDef from within a <tt>@Bind</tt> annotation, by using the name of the field that was annotated. They can be compositional as well. The following binding in MyAspect uses the defined CFlowStackDefs
</p><p>
<pre>
   @Bind (pointcut="execution(void POJO-&gt;method4())", cflow="(MyAspect.cf123Before OR MyAspect.cf123Before)")
   public Object methodAdvice(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable
   {
      ...
   }

</pre>
This says to trigger the SimpleInterceptor on the execution of method4, but only when it is called within the context of method1, method2, and method3 OR contructor and method3.
</p><p>
The next example in MyAspect is for recursive methods.  The example CFlowStackDef says that two calls to the recursive method must be in the call stack, but no more
<pre>
   @CFlowStackDef (cflows={@CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;recursive(int)", called=true), @CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;recursive(int)", called=true), @CFlowDef(expr = "void POJO-&gt;recursive(int)", called=false)})
   public static CFlowStack cf2Recursions;

   @Bind (pointcut="execution(void POJO-&gt;recursive(int))", cflow="MyAspect.cf2Recursions")
   public Object recursiveAdvice(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable
   {
      ...
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
Combined with the execution binding, the SimpleInterceptor will only be triggered on the second call to the recursive method.
</p><p>
<h4>Run the example</h4>

To compile and run:
<pre>
  $ ant
</pre>
It will javac the files and then run the AOPC precompiler to manipulate the bytecode, then finally run the example.  The output should read as follows:
<pre>
run:
     [java] --- pojo.method4(); ---
     [java] method4
     [java] --- pojo.method3(); ---
     [java] method3
     [java] method4
     [java] --- pojo.method2(); ---
     [java] method2
     [java] method3
     [java] method4
     [java] --- pojo.method1(); ---
     [java] method1
     [java] method2
     [java] method3
     [java] &lt;&lt;&lt; MyAdvice.methodAdvice accessing: public void POJO.method4()
     [java] method4
     [java] &gt;&gt;&gt; Leaving MyAdvice.methodAdvice
     [java] --- pojo.recursive(); ---
     [java] recursive: 1
     [java] recursive: 2
     [java] recursive: 3
     [java] --- new POJO(int); ---
     [java] method3
     [java] method4
</pre>
