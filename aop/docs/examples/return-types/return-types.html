<h2>Advice Return Types</h2>

</p><p>
<h4>Overview</h4>

Around and after advices can return values and overwrite the joinpoint value. In
this example we show how to do that.
</p><p>
<h4>Default Signature</h4>

</p><p>
This signature, for around advices only, demands a <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> return
type.
Notice that this signature is valid for any joipoint, no matter whether it has a
return value, and, if it does, whether this value is primitive or not (a wrapper
object is expected if the joinpoint returns a primitive value).
</p><p>
An example of this signature is <tt>Aspect.aroundDefaultSignature()</tt> advice:
</p><p>
<pre>
public Object aroundDefaultSignature(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable
</pre>
</p><p>
Open up <tt>jboss-aop.xml</tt> and verify that this advice is applied to
a method that returns a primitive value, a method that returns a non-primitive value,
and a <tt>void</tt> method.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h4>Annotated-Parameter Signature</h4>

</p><p>
</p><p>
In this signature, return types are safely checked. Differently than the default
signature, an advice can't return an invalid typed value. For example, by declaring
to return <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> when the joinpoint return type is
<tt>java.util.Collection</tt>, an advice could return a <tt>java.lang.String</tt> value (this
would result in a <tt>RuntimeException</tt>).
When using annotated-parameter signature, this code wouldn't compile.
In that case, an advice could, however, return a <tt>java.util.List</tt> typed value,
since this class is a subtype of the joinpoint return type.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Around Advices</b>
</p><p>
When using an annotated-parameter signature, around advices are obliged to return
a value. This is pretty much the same as with the default signature. However, here
it must return a value with the same type as the joinpoint return value, or a subtype.
Notice that, if the joinpoint return type is <tt>void</tt>, the around advice should
be <tt>void</tt> too.
</p><p>
To illustrate all this, let's look at the around advices contained in this example,
by starting with this one:
</p><p>
<pre>
public int aroundAnnotatedParam(@JoinPoint MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable
{
   ...
   return  5000;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt>Aspect.aroundAnnotatedParam()</tt> advice overwrites the method return value
with the <tt>5000 int</tt> value. This advice intercepts a method that returns an
<tt>int</tt> value, and has the same return type as it.
</p><p>
On the other hand, <tt>Aspect.aroundArrayList()</tt> does not return the same type
of the joinpoint it intercepts. It returns a subtype instead:
</p><p>
<pre>
public ArrayList aroundArrayList(@JoinPoint MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable
{
	...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This advice intercepts a method whose return type is <tt>java.util.List</tt> and, so, its
return type is valid. It wouldn't be valid if it was a superclass of
<tt>java.util.List</tt>, like <tt>java.util.Collection</tt>. This avoids the advice returning a
<tt>java.util.Vector</tt>, for example, when the joinpoint return value is expected to be
of type <tt>java.util.List</tt>.
</p><p>
Finally, take a look at <tt>aroundVoid</tt>:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void aroundVoid(@JoinPoint MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable
{
   ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This advice is <tt>void</tt> and can be applied only to joinpoints that don't return
values. This is the case of <tt>void POJO.doNothing()</tt> method execution, and it
would also be the case of a <tt>void</tt> method call, or a field read/write
joinpoint.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>After Advices</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Differently from around advices, after advices are not forced to return a value.
They should return it only when they intend to replace the joinpoint value.
</p><p>
Let's take a look at a few examples;
</p><p>
<pre>
public int afterOverwriteReturnValue(@Return int returnValue)
{
	...
	return returnValue/5;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This advice is applied to a joinpoint that returns an <tt>int</tt> value. Notice that it
receives the value returned by the joinpoint (or by an advice that has executed
before this one, if there are other advices involved), and returns one fifith of its
value.
</p><p>
Our next advice:
</p><p>
<pre>
public List afterUnmodifiableList(@Return List returnValue)
{
	...
   return Collections.unmodifiableList(returnValue);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Intercepts <tt>POJO.getList()</tt> method, that returns a <tt>java.util.List</tt>
object. The same return type is used by this advice, that overwrites the joinpoint
return value with an unmodifiable version of the original list.
</p><p>
Since after advices are not enforced to return values, <tt>afterVoid</tt> advice, of
type <tt>void</tt>, can be used to intercept any joinpoint, no matter wheter the
joinpoint has a return value or not:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void afterVoid()
{
   ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h4>Run the example</h4>

<p>
To compile and run (for further detail, refer to our <a href="../running_examples.html"/>Compiling and Running Examples Guide</a>):</p>
<pre>
  $ ant run.aopc
</pre>
<p>It will javac the files and then run the AOPC precompiler to manipulate the bytecode, then finally run the example.  The output should be similar to this:</p>
<pre>
