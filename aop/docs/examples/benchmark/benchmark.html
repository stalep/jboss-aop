<h2>JBoss AOP Benchmark</h2>

</p><p>
<h4>Overview</h4>

This example benches constructor, method, field execution pointcuts as well as a method caller pointcut.  There are 3 tests for each type.  
</p><p>
<ol>
<li> Unadvised is a non-aoped call.  There is also some numbers in there for raw Java reflection to compare to the overhead of JBoss AOP.  </li>
<li> Advised means that there are no interceptors attached as part of the test.  JBoss AOP is highly optimized when there are no interceptors.  Remember, you can &lt;prepare&gt; an Java class so that you can hot-deploy interceptors/advices at runtime.</li>
<li> Intercepted means that there is one simple interceptor that is run as part of the test.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<h4>Running</h4>

To compile and run:
<pre>
  $ ant
</pre>
It will javac the files and then run the AOPC precompiler to manipulate the bytecode, then finally run the example.
