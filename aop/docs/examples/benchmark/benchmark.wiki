!!!JBoss AOP Benchmark

!Overview
This example benches constructor, method, field execution pointcuts as well as a method caller pointcut.  There are 3 tests for each type.  

* Unadvised is a non-aoped call.  There is also some numbers in there for raw Java reflection to compare to the overhead of JBoss AOP.  
* Advised means that there are no interceptors attached as part of the test.  JBoss AOP is highly optimized when there are no interceptors.  Remember, you can <prepare> an Java class so that you can hot-deploy interceptors/advices at runtime.
* Intercepted means that there is one simple interceptor that is run as part of the test.

!Running
To compile and run:
{{{
  $ ant
}}}
It will javac the files and then run the AOPC precompiler to manipulate the bytecode, then finally run the example.
