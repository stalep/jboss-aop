<h1>Compiling and Running Examples</h1>

<h2>Run with Ant</h2>
<p>There are two targets for running the examples with Ant:<p>
<pre>
$ ant run.aopc
$ ant run.loadtime
</pre>

<h3>ant run.aopc</h3>
<p>The <i>run.aopc</i> target uses compile-time weaving, and performs the following steps:
<ul>
   <li>compiles the classes;</li>
   <li>runs the <code>aopc</code> compiler;</li>
   <li>and runs the woven example.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ant run.loadtime</h3>
<p>The <i>run.loadtime</i> target uses load-time weaving (the classes are
transformed when first loaded) and performs the following steps:
<ul>
   <li>compiles the classes;</li>
   <li>and runs the example with the <i>-javagent</i> switch passed in to
   the java runtime to enable loadtime weaving;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Run with Maven</h2>

<p>Just run:</p>
<pre>
$ mvn install
</pre>
<p>This will compile and run the application classes. A few of the examples use compile time weaving, and others
use loadtime weaving. You can always change between one or the other form by uncommenting sections of the pom.xml
file.</p>
<p>The logging example is the only example that use profiles to change from using log4j or the system.out logger.
