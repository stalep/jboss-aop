<h2>Annotated Advice Parameters</h2>

</p><p>
<h4>Overview</h4>

In generated advisor (default) mode, before, after and around advices can receive
annotated parameters. The use of annotations provides maximum flexibility to the
signature of advices, since an advice can receive only the values that are relevant
to its execution. These parameters can be in any order and their type can be the type
that is most suitable to the advice functionality, according to the joinpoints it
intercepts.
</p><p>
<h4>Annotated Parameter Signature</h4>

</p><p>
The annotated parameter signature is defined as:
</p><p>
<pre>
public &lt;return-value&gt; &lt;any-method-name&gt;(@&lt;Annotation&gt; &lt;any type&gt; arg0, @&lt;Annotation&gt; &lt;any type&gt; arg1, ... , @&lt;Annotation&gt; &lt;any type&gt; argN) throws &lt;Exception1&gt;,&lt;Exception2&gt;,...,&lt;ExceptionN&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
This signature is  available for all kinds of advices in JBoss AOP (when running in
the generated advisor instrumentation mode). Besides this one, JBoss AOP supports the
default around signature, introduced in the <a href="../aspect/aspect.html">Aspect example</a>.
The default signature can only be used to write around advices, and is supported on
all instrumentation modes.
</p><p>
Basicaly, this signature allows an advice to receive zero or more annotated
parameters, in any order, and with any valid type. Regarding the exception types, an
advice is allowed to declare any exception in its signature. <tt>RuntimeException</tt>s
are rethrown by JBoss AOP as is. The same goes for exceptions
that are not runtime, if they are declared in the joinpoint exceptions list
(supposing the joinpoint has an exception list). Otherwise, the exception will be
wrapped in a <tt>RuntimeException</tt>. In all cases, the application would get the
exception as if the joinpoint itself had thrown it.
</p><p>
A concrete example of this signature has been shown in the <a href="../beforeafter/beforeafter.html">before/after</a> example:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeAdvice(@JoinPoint Joinpoint joinPoint)
</pre>
</p><p>
As we can see, this advice receives one parameter annotated with
<tt>@JoinPoint</tt>.
</p><p>
Next, we will see all parameter annotations that can be used by an advice. Notice
that an empty parameter list is also valid, as in the following signatures:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeNoParameters()

public Object aroundNoParameters() throws Throwable

public void afterNoParameters()
</pre>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<h4>Parameter Annotations</h4>

</p><p>
JBoss AOP demands the use of parameter annotations to identify advice parameters.
These parameters can represent several values, like the joinpoint target, a joinpoint
argument, or its return value. In this example, we show all parameter annotations
that can be used by before, after and around advices to identify those values. These
annotations are located in the <tt>org.jboss.aop.advice.annotation</tt> package.
</p><p>
The type of an annotated parameter can be chosen accordingly to the value it refers
to. For example, suppose you are intercepting a jointpoint with an argument of type
<tt>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</tt>. Advices that refer to this argument as being of type
<tt>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</tt>, or <tt>Collection&lt;String&gt;</tt> or <tt>Object</tt> would all be
considered correct. This is useful because you can access specific operations and
fields of the argument, without performing a cast, and yet you can receive a super
type like <tt>Object</tt> and refer to arguments of different types when your advice is
applied to different joinpoints.
</p><p>
As a convention, we named the advices of this example after the names of
parameter annotations. Besides, all advices names are prefixed with their types names
(before advice names start with <tt>"before"</tt>, and so on). But it is important
to point out that, as all previous examples, the name of advices can be chosen freely
and JBoss AOP won't use these names to identify annotated parameters.
</p><p>
<b>@JoinPoint</b>
</p><p>
This annotation is used on objects that represent a joinpoint. If the advice
is an around advice, the type of this object belongs to the
<a href="../../misc/invocation.html">Invocation class hierarchy</a>. On all other
advices, joinpoints are represented by types of the
<a href="../../misc/joinpoint.html">JoinPointBean interface hierarchy</a>, as follows:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeJoinPoint(@JoinPoint JoinPointBean joinPoint)

public Object aroundJoinPoint(@JoinPoint CallerInvocation invocation) throws Throwable

public void afterJoinPoint(@JoinPoint ConstructorExecution joinPoint)
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how <tt>beforeJoinPoint</tt> advice receives a parameter of the supertype
<tt>JoinPointBean</tt> while, in <tt>afterJoinPoint</tt>, the parameter is of the more
specific type <tt>ConstructorExecution</tt>, valid only on constructor execution
joinpoints.
To see these and all other advice examples, open up the <tt>Aspect.java</tt> file.
</p><p>
<b>@Target</b>
</p><p>
This annotation is used on parameters that refer to the joinpoint target. The
joinpoint target is defined according to the joinpoint type. For example, the target
of a method execution is the object whose method is being executed. On a call
joinpoint, the target is the object whose method is being called. On a field access
joinpoint, the target is the object that contains the field. Notice that not all
joinpoints have a target; namelly: static method executions and calls, static field
reads and writes, and constructor executions and calls.
</p><p>
Examples of usage of this annotation follow:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeTarget(@Target Object target)

public Object aroundTarget(@Target POJO target) throws Throwable

public void afterTarget(@Target POJO target) throws Throwable
</pre>
</p><p>
By opening up <tt>jboss-aop.xml</tt>, you can see that the target of all these
advices is of type <tt>POJO</tt>, yet <tt>beforeTarget</tt> advice receives a target
of type <tt>Object</tt>. Since <tt>POJO</tt> extends <tt>Object</tt>, this is
perfectly valid, and useful when an advice intercepts joinpoints with different
target types.
</p><p>
<b>@Caller</b>
</p><p>
This annotation is used on parameters that refer to the caller object, during a call
joinpoint interception. This should be used only on call joinpoints. If the call is
inside a static method, the caller will be <tt>null</tt>.
Examples follow:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeCaller(@Caller POJO caller)

public Object aroundCaller(@Caller Driver target) throws Throwable

public void afterCaller(@Caller Object target)
</pre>
</p><p>
<b>@Return</b>
</p><p>
Use this annotation only on after advices, to refer to the joinpoint return value:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void afterFieldReturn(@Return Object joinPointReturn)

public void afterMethodReturn(@Return boolean joinPointReturn)
</pre>
</p><p>
<b>@Arg</b>
</p><p>
This annotation is used to refer to a joinpoint argument. Since a joinpoint can
receive more than one argument, this is the only annotation that can be used on more
than one advice parameters.
Look at these examples:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeConstructorArg(@Arg Object argument)

public Object aroundConstructorArg(@Arg String argument) throws Throwable

public void afterArg(@Arg int argument)
</pre>
</p><p>
When the joinpoint receives multiple arguments, JBoss AOP infers to which
argument an <tt>@Arg</tt> annotated parameter refers. In this example, both
<tt>beforeConstructorArg</tt> and <tt>aroundConstructorArg</tt> are applied to
<tt>POJO</tt> constructor, whose unique argument is of type <tt>java.lang.String</tt>.
So, the parameters of these advices will refer to this constructor argument.
On the other hand, <tt>afterArg</tt> advice is applied to more than one method
executions:
</p><p>
<pre>
public class POJO
{
   ...

   public boolean someMethod(int argument)
   {
      ...
   }

   public void method(long arg0, int arg1, long arg2, String arg3)
   {
      ...
   }

   ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Wen intercepting <tt>POJO.someMethod(int)</tt> execution, the parameter of <tt>afterArg</tt>
will contain the value of the single argument <tt>someMethod</tt> received, as it happens
with <tt>beforeConstructorArg</tt> and <tt>aroundConstructorArg</tt> advices. But, when
intercepting <tt>POJO.method(long,int,long,String)</tt>, JBoss AOP will automatically
associate <tt>afterArg</tt> parameter with the parameter at index position <tt>1</tt>, of type
<tt>int</tt>.
</p><p>
Associating the <tt>int</tt> value to to an argument of
<tt>POJO.method(long,int,long,String)</tt> is easy, because there is only one joinpoint
argument of that type. The same does not apply to the following advice:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeMethodArg(@Arg long argument)
</pre>
</p><p>
Given that <tt>POJO-&gt;method(long,int,long,String)</tt> has two arguments of type <tt>long</tt>,
JBoss AOP will pick the first <tt>long</tt> typed argument. If you want to refer to the
second <tt>long</tt> typed argument, in position <tt>2</tt>, you can use the optional
<tt>@Arg.index</tt> element as is shown below:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeMethodArg2(@Arg(index=2) long argument)
</pre>
This element can be set everytime JBoss AOP does not associate your <tt>@Arg</tt>
annotated parameter with the joinpoint argument you want to receive.
</p><p>
<b>@Args</b>
</p><p>
Finally, this annotation is used on advice parameters of type <tt>java.lang.Object[]</tt>, that contain the complete list of the joinpoint arguments.
</p><p>
Look at these examples:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeArgs(@Args Object[] arguments)

public Object aroundArgs(@Args Object[] arguments) throws Throwable

public void afterArgs(@Args Object[] arguments)
</pre>
</p><p>
Use this annotation when you need a generic advice, that receives all arguments
without knowing how many arguments there are, or their types. Using <tt>@Args
</tt> instead of a list of <tt>@Arg</tt> annotated parameters is also useful when you need to
change one or more joinpoint argument values. An example is the <tt>beforeArgs</tt> advice,
that ovewrites two argument values of <tt>POJO.method(long,int,long,String)</tt> execution:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void beforeArgs(@Args Object[] arguments)
{
   ...
   arguments[3] = "overridenString";
   arguments[1] = Integer.valueOf(((Integer)arguments[1]).intValue() - 50);
   ...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Avoid using <tt>@Args</tt> when none of those conditions apply. This
parameter type can incur in the creation of an array and of wrapper objects (as is
the case of argument 1 above). Besides, you have the extra cost of downcasting
the arguments.
</p><p>
Needless to say, extreme care is needed when changing the arguments array. If an
argument value is overriden with one of a different type, an error will be thrown.
</p><p>

<h3>Run the example</h3>

<p>
To compile and run (for further detail, refer to our <a href="../running_examples.html"/>Compiling and Running Examples Guide</a>):</p>
<pre>
  $ ant run.aopc
</pre>
<p>It will javac the files and then run the AOPC precompiler to manipulate the bytecode, then finally run the example.  The output should be similar to this:</p>
