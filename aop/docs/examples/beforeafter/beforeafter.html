<h2>Before and After Advices</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
JBoss AOP provides several types of advices. The advices seen on the previous
section, as well as JBoss AOP interceptors, provide around join point interception.
In this example we introduce before and after advices, and compare their roles to
around advices' role.
</p><p>
<h4>Writing Before/After Advices</h4>
</p><p>
Before and after advices are lightweight advices when compared to around advices.
JBoss AOP invokes these advices before or after the joinpoint execution.
</p><p>
As we will see in the next <a href="../annotatedparam-return/annotatedparam-return.html">
example</a>, these advices can have several different signatures. However, in our
first example, we will use signatures that are closest to what has been shown on
previous examples.
   
So, we introduce a before and after advices as being of the form:
</p><p>
<pre>
public void &lt;any-method-name&gt;(@JoinPoint &lt;any Joinpoint type&gt;)
</pre>
</p><p>
Differently from around advices and interceptors, throwing a <tt>Throwable</tt> is
not necessary, because these advices do not wrap a joinpoint.
</p><p>
Instead of <tt>Invocation</tt> instances, before/after advices receive instances
of <a href="../../misc/joinpoint.html"><tt>org.jboss.aop.IJoinpointInfo</tt> and
subinterfaces</a> as parameters.
</p><p>
Besides this difference, one can notice the presence of parameter annotation <tt>
&#64;org.jboss.aop.advice.annotation.JoinPoint</tt>. This is necessary because
before/after advices can receive values with several semantic roles as parameters.
As we will see <a href="../annotatedparam-return/annotatedparam-return.html">next</a>,
this annotation is used to distinguish this parameter type from the other ones, so we 
can achieve flexibility on the type, order and presence of advice parameters.
</p><p>
<h4>Binding Before/After Advices</h4>
</p><p>
To bind a before/after advice to a pointcut, you only need to declare an xml binding as
follows (please, open up <tt>jboss-aop.xml</tt> to see this example):
</p><p>
<pre>
&lt;bind pointcut="execution(public void $instanceof{Transaction}->run())"&gt;
      &lt;before name="beforeAdvice" aspect="mypackage.MutexAspect"/&gt;
      &lt;after name="afterAdvice" aspect="mypackage.MutexAspect"/&gt;
&lt/bind&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, you just need to declare a usual bind tag, and add to it 
<tt>&lt;before&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;after&gt;</tt> tags for before and after advices
respectively. Notice that we can mix interceptor declarations and around, before, and
after advices declarations in a single binding.
</p><p>
   
<h4>Around, Before and After Advices</h4>
</p><p>

As seen on previous sections, around advices wrap the joinpoint execution. An around
advice replaces the joinpoint execution in the base system, and is responsible for
forwarding execution to the joinpoint itself, as well as for returning a value to the
base system.
</p><p>
Around advices can be composed by four parts at most: a before joinpoint execution
block, a proceed to joinpoint step, an after joinpoint execution block, and, finally,
a return value step. To see an example, consider this <tt>PER_VM</tt> scoped aspect:
</p><p>
<pre>
public class SynchronizationAspect
{
   public Object aroundAdvice(Invocation invocation) throws Throwable
   {
      Object result;

      // part 1: retrive lock before joinpoint execution
      synchronized(this)
      {
         System.out.println("&gt;&gt;&gt; Retrieved concurrency lock");
   
         // part 2: proceed to joinpoint execution
         result = invocation.invokeNext();
   
      // part 3: release lock after joinpoint execution
         System.out.println("&lt;&lt;&lt; Releasing concurrency lock");
      }
   
      // part 4: return result
      return result;
   }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt>SynchronizationAspect</tt> synchronizes all intercepted joinpoints (in a
concurrent programming application), avoiding that two or more intercepted joinpoints
run at the same time.
</p><p>
As we can see, <tt>SynchronizationAspect.aroundAdvice()</tt> is composed of four
steps:

<list>
   <li>retrieving a lock before the joinpoint execution, achieved by entering the
      <tt>synchronized</tt> block;</li>
   <li>proceeding to joinpoint execution;</li>
   <li>releasing the lock after the joinpoint execution, achieved by exiting the
      <tt>synchronized</tt> block;</li>
   <li>and returning joinpoint result.</li>
</list>

</p><p>
Notice that this advice does not alter joinpoint execution (the advice does not
skip it) nor its return result (the advice could overwrite this value, but returns
the joinpoint return value itself instead). Hence, we can say that the relevant part
of it is only what is performed before and after the joinpoint (parts 1 and 3). To
ilustrate the before/after concept, we wish to replace this single around advice
by a couple of before/after advices. However, we cannot do that by using the
previous example. A synchronized block cannot be splitten into two parts and still
achieve the same effect. So, lets first replace this around advice by one that uses a
mutex intead of a synchronized block:
</p><p>
<pre>
public class MutexAspect
{
   private Object lock = new Object();
   private boolean locked = false;   
   
   public Object aroundAdvice(Invocation invocation) throws Throwable
   {
      Object result;
   
      // part 1: retrive lock before joinpoint execution
      synchronized(lock)
      {
         while (locked)
         {
            try
            {
               lock.wait();
            }
            catch(InterruptedException e)
            {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
               return; 
            }
         }
         locked = true;
         System.out.println("&gt;&gt;&gt; Retrieved concurrency lock");
      }
   
      // part 2: proceed to joinpoint execution
      result = invocation.invokeNext();
   
      // part 3: release lock after joinpoint execution
      synchronized(lock)
      {
         locked = false;
         lock.notify();
         System.out.println("&lt;&lt;&lt; Releasing concurrency lock");
      }
      
      // part 4: return result
      return result;
   }
}
</pre>         
</p><p>

As much as <tt>SynchronizedAspect</tt>, <tt>MutexAspect</tt> avoids simultaneous
access to the intercepted joinpoint, and is also composed of the four steps
(getting a lock, proceeding to joinpoint execution and releasing the lock).
</p><p>
However, we can easily split this around advice into two advices: one that retrieves
the lock, and another one that releases it. We wish to run the first one before a
joinpoint, and the other one, after it.
</p><p>
The example that follows is a copy of the previous one, except that, now, <tt>
MutexAspect.aroundAdvice()</tt> has been splitten into <tt>MutexAspect.beforeAdvice()
</tt> and <tt>MutexAspect.afterAdvice()</tt>:
</p><p>
<pre>
public class MutexAspect
{
   private Object lock = new Object();
   private boolean locked = false;   
   
   public void beforeAdvice(@JoinPoint Joinpoint joinPoint)
   {
      synchronized(lock)
      {
         while (locked)
         {
            try
            {
               lock.wait();
            }
            catch(InterruptedException e)
            {
               Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
               return; 
            }
         }
         locked = true;
         System.out.println("&gt;&gt;&gt; Retrieved concurrency lock");
      }
   }
   
   public void afterAdvice(@JoinPoint Joinpoint joinPoint)
   {
      synchronized(lock)
      {
         locked = false;
         lock.notify();
         System.out.println("&lt;&lt;&lt; Releasing concurrency lock");
      }
   }
}
</pre>         
</p><p>
Notice that, in this version, parts 2 and 4 are gone (proceeding to joinpoint
execution and returning its result). This is due to the fact that before and after
advices don't wrap a joinpoint, they are just executed before or after it.

</p><p>
<h4>Around vs Before/After</h4>
</p><p>
As is shown in this example, around advices can generally be broken into two related
before and after advices. The reverse is also true.
However, there are some subtleties that can help you to choose one form or the
other.
</p><p>
First of all, these are advantages of using around advices:
</p><p>
<list>
<li>capability of replacing the entire joinpoint execution, by skipping the call to
   <tt>Invocation.invokeNext() method</tt>;</li>
<li>capability of skipping the invocation of subsequent around advices and
   interceptors, by calling <tt>Invocation.invokeTarget()</tt> instead of
   <tt>Invocation.invokeNext()</tt>;</li>
<li>addition of meta-data, available on Invocation objects only.</li>
</list>
</p><p>
Besides this list, there are aspects that cannot be implemented as a pair of before
and after advices. An example would be the <tt>SynchronizedAspect</tt> shown before.
A synchronized block cannot be broken into two blocks and achieve the
same result as one single synchronized block. In the example, we wrote a similar,
more complex aspect to ilustrate the before/after advice concept. In real
applications, however, this aspect would not be replaced by a more complex one,
unless this could bring advantages to the application.
</p><p>
When one needs one or more of the cited capabilities, or has an aspect that needs
to be written as an around advice, we advise the use of around advices.
</p><p>
On the other hand, before and after advices also provide some advantages. A pair of
related before/after advices:
</p><p>
<list>
<li>is lightweight, when compared to around advices</li>
<li>can be bound to different joinpoints. The before advice can be invoked before
joinpoint A and after advice, after joinPoint B</li>   
</list>
</p><p>
Regarding the second item in the list, notice that this can be extremely useful in
the case of MutexAspect. Instead of controling the multi-threaded access to a single
joinpoint, we could obtain the lock before a joinpoint, and release it later,
after a different joinpoint execution. This allows the synchronization of a sequence
of joinpoints as if they were a single unit.
</p><p>
Notice that replacing the joinpoint return value is not inherent to around advices
and interceptors. An after advice can also return a value (for more on this, refer to
<a href="../returnvalue/returnvalue.html">Return Value</a>).
</p><p>
<h4>Unrelated Before and After Advices</h4>
</p><p>
Despite the application of before and after advices shown in this example, these
advices can also be used in an unrelated, independent manner.
</p><p>
An aspect whose code needs to run only before the joinpoint execution should contain
only before advices. The same applies to an aspect that needs to execute after
a joinpoint execution, regarding after advices. Furthermore, an aspect that provides
functionalities that need to be run before a joinpoint execution, and functionalities
that need to be run after, should contain a mix of unrelated before and after advices.
</p><p>
Examples of unrelated before and after advices will be shown in the next topics of
this tutorial.
</p><p>
<h4>Applying MutexAspect</h4>
</p><p>
In our example, we apply <tt>MutexAspect</tt> to a classic example of sinchronization
and concurrent programming application.
</p><p>
Suppose you have bank accounts and operations on accounts can be performed
concurrently. If we don't synchronize those operations we can end up with an invalid
account balance.
</p><p>
An example would be two operations on account <tt>A</tt>. Suppose one of them
is a deposit of $30.00, while the other one is a withdrawal of $10.00. If these
operations are run in an unsynchronized manner, like follows:
</p><p>
<list>
<li>deposit: read balance: $50.00</li>
<li>withdrawal: read balance: $50.00</li>
<li>deposit: add $30.00</li>
<li>withdrawal: subtract $10.00</li>
<li>deposit: write final balance of $80.00</li>
<li>withdrawal: write final balance of $40.00</li>
</list>
The final balance of the account would be $40.00, and the deposit of $50.00 would
have been completely ignored, since its final balance has been overwritten by 
the withdrawal operation.
</p><p>
<h4>Running</h4>
</p><p>
To compile and run:
<pre>
  $ ant
</pre>
It will javac the files and then run the AOPC precompiler to manipulate the bytecode, then finally run the example.  The output should be similar to this:
<pre>
