!!!Tutorial

This directory contains sample programs to test drive JBossAOP. They should probably be run in order, but feel free to skip around.

!! XML examples

The XML examples give a fuller coverage of the features of the AOP framework

!! Annotation examples

The annotation examples are shorter, since they assume you have already been through the XML examples and already understand the AOP basics. Their aim is to introduce you to how to achieve the same using JDK 5.0 annotations. __To run them you will need to set up your environment so that you are running JDK 5.0__
