<h2> The HAS and HASFIELD operator</h2>

</p><p>
The HAS operator within a pointcut expression allows you to inquire about extra information of the pointcut's target class.  Let's say you have an constructor execution pointcut:
<pre>
execution(*-&gt;new(..))
</pre>
</p><p>
You can add a HAS expression to narrow down the expression to include the execution of any constructor who's class has a method setValue:
<pre>
execution(*-&gt;new(..)) AND has(void *-&gt;setValue(int))
</pre>
</p><p>
You can also do the same with fields.  Let's say we also wanted to narrow it down to all classes that have a Thread field:
</p><p>
<pre>
execution(*-&gt;new(..)) AND hasfield(java.lang.Thread *.*)
</pre>
</p><p>
<h4>Inversion of Control</h4>

</p><p>
How is this useful?  A usecase is Inversion of Control (IoC).  IoC is about injecting an object's depencies transparently.  You could define an aspect that intercepted a constructor call, and on the return inject these dependencies into the object.  The has operator allows you to do this and this is what the example program does.
</p><p>
The example uses the following binding:
<pre>
   &lt;bind pointcut="execution(*-&gt;new(..)) AND has(public void *-&gt;setInjectedParameter(int))"&gt;
       &lt;interceptor class="DependencyInjectorInterceptor"/&gt;
   &lt;/bind&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
On any constructor call where the constructor's class has a public setInjectedParameter method, call the DependencyInjectorInterceptor.  The DependencyInjectorInterceptor will call the constructed object's setInjectedParameter.
